# Statistical-Analysis-of-a-dataset
Statistical analysis means investigating trends, patterns, and relationships using quantitative data. It is an important research tool used by scientists, governments, businesses, and other organizations.
# Types of Measures
### Central tendency tells you about the centers of the data. Useful measures include the mean, median, and mode.
### Variability tells you about the spread of the data. Useful measures include variance and standard deviation.
### Correlation or joint variability tells you about the relation between a pair of variables in a dataset. Useful measures include covariance and the correlation coefficient.
# Measures of Central Tendency
The measures of central tendency show the central or middle values of datasets. There are several definitions of what’s considered to be the center of a dataset.
## Mean
## Weighted mean
## Geometric mean
## Harmonic mean
## Median
## Mode
# Measures of Variability
The measures of central tendency aren’t sufficient to describe data. You’ll also need the measures of variability that quantify the spread of data points.
## Variance,
## Standard deviation,
## Skewness,
## Percentiles,
## Ranges.
